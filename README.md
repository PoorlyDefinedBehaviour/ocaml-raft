## TODO

- Use eio in the network and storage layer
- Persist last applied index to avoid reapplying the whole log
- Heartbeat timeout handling. Reset timeout
- Handle exceptions
- Stop using lists
- Check that data is correctly stored in the state file (look at the file contents and ensure there's nothing weird stored in there)
- Remove completed todos
